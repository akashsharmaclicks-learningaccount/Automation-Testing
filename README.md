# 🚀 API Automation Testing with TestCafe 🚀

Welcome to the API Automation Testing project using TestCafe! This project focuses on automating API tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of APIs using powerful tools like TestCafe, TypeScript, and Postman.

## Overview

In this project, I explored TestCafe's capabilities to automate API tests effectively. I created a Postman collection of over 50 free APIs and wrote detailed automation scripts in TypeScript to test every edge case. This approach allows thorough testing, ensuring the APIs' performance and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **💻 TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that scales.
- **🧪 TestCafe**: A powerful and easy-to-use framework for testing web applications, including API testing.
- **🌐 Postman**: A platform for building, testing, and documenting APIs.
- **🐙 GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## Project Highlights

- **Postman Collection**: Over 50 free APIs were collected and documented.
- **Edge Case Testing**: Detailed automation scripts were created to test every possible scenario.
- **TestCafe**: Leveraged TestCafe for running and managing the automation tests efficiently.

## Video Walkthrough

Check out the video walkthrough where I demonstrate the entire process, from designing the APIs collection on Postman to implementing the functionality and running the automation scripts.
